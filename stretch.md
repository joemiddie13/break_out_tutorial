Some potential issues with the code base for this tutorial:

Global Variables: The code uses a lot of global variables. While this isn't necessarily a problem for a small script like this, it can lead to issues in larger applications. Consider encapsulating related variables and functions within objects or classes.

Hard-Coded Values: The code contains hard-coded values, like the brick offset and the number of lives. These could be made into configurable parameters to make the game more flexible.

Event Listener Cleanup: The code adds event listeners but never removes them. In a real-world application, you'd want to remove these listeners when they're no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.

Key Handler Compatibility: The keyDownHandler and keyUpHandler functions use e.key, which is not fully supported in all browsers. Consider using e.keyCode for better compatibility.
